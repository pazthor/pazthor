## Commit overview

Use `commit_overview.py` to print recent commits from your GitHub and GitLab projects.

```bash
python commit_overview.py \
  --github-token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --github-owner YOUR_GITHUB_USER \
  --github-repo YOUR_GITHUB_REPO \
  --gitlab-token YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN \
  --gitlab-project YOUR_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID
```

The script fetches the latest commits from each platform and prints a short summary.

If you provide an OpenAI API key via `--openai-key`, the script will also
generate an AI summary of the commit messages.

### Running in GitHub Actions

This repository includes a workflow in `.github/workflows/commit_overview.yml`
that runs the script. Configure the required secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_PROJECT`, and optionally
`OPENAI_API_KEY`) and trigger the workflow manually from the Actions tab.
