## Commit overview

Use `commit_overview.py` to print recent commits from your GitHub and GitLab projects.

```bash
python commit_overview.py \
  --github-token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --github-owner YOUR_GITHUB_USER \
  --github-repo YOUR_GITHUB_REPO \
  --gitlab-token YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN \
  --gitlab-project YOUR_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID
```

The script fetches the latest commits from each platform and prints a short summary.
